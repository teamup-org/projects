# What do we do?
We design [real-world projects](https://github.com/teamup-org/projects/wiki) for student developers that address social issues and community needs. In our projects repository, you'll find a collection of technical challenges sourced from nonprofits, local governments, and community organizations. 

# Why do we do this?
Each project aims to have a positive civic impact, whether it's helping the environment, assisting vulnerable populations, or bridging communication gaps. Our projects are scoped for students to build functional prototypes or working pilots with mentorship from industry experts. If you're a student looking to level up your skills while making a difference, browse our projects to join a team today. Let's use technology to build a better future, together.
